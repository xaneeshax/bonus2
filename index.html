        Motivation 
    </h2>
    <p>
        I was looking to visualize a statistic regarding the American population for this assignment. While looking through many
        different databases maintained by US organizations I came across a database that kept track of names for baby girls born
        in 2020. I thought it would be interesting to see what the most common names people are naming their daughters in America,
        the average length of the name and how popular each of the top names were.

        Data Sources and Cleaning
    </h2>
    <p>
        The data source that I used to conduct this analysis can be found at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html. This 
        dataset is provided by the US Social Security Team and stores the Top 1000 baby girl names for each year. The data is organized 
        into 3 columns: Name, Gender, and Occurrences. In order to sort the data I used Python to convert the data from a long text file
        to a dataframe. I then sorted the data by occurrences and stored the Top 15 names for the year. In addition, I used the given data 
        to determine how long each name was and how  many names there were of that length. This analysis was done in python in order to determine
        what the average length of a name is in 2020.

        Analysis & Insights:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Top 15 names for girls in the US all comprise of names that have been on the "leaderboard" for the past decade. 
        For more context about 1.8 million girls were born in the US in 2020. The most common name was Olivia which was has
        a count of about 17,500. This means that about 1 in 103 girls were named Olivia. Moreover, about 1 in 10 baby girls have 
        a name that's in the Top 15 as shown above.

        Analysis & Insights:
    </h2>
    <p>
        With this given dataset, I thought it would be fascinating to see what the most common length of name would be.
        As shown in the visual, there are about 10,000 different names that have six characters. There were also a few names
        that were as short as two letters and as long as 14. In summary, there are a lot more names in America that are about
        5 to 7 letters long.
